To contribute:

1. **Fork the project** by clicking the "Fork" button at the top of this page.
2. **Clone your fork locally**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/arduino-weather-station.git
    ```
3. **Create a new feature branch** for your work:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature
    ```
4. **Make your changes**, and ensure they meet the project's coding standards.
5. **Commit your changes**:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Add AmazingFeature"
    ```
6. **Push your changes** to your forked repository:
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/AmazingFeature
    ```
7. **Open a pull request** from your feature branch to the main repository.

#### Creating a New Release

Once your pull request has been approved and merged, follow these steps to create a new release if your changes require it:

1. **Ensure your branch is up-to-date with `main`**:
    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git pull origin main
    ```
2. **Add details to the `CHANGELOG.md`**:
    - Update the changelog with a clear description of the new feature, improvement, or bug fix.
    - Use an appropriate versioning convention (e.g., `v1.0.1`, `v1.1.0`).

3. **Create a new tag** for the release:
    ```bash
    git tag -a vX.X.X -m "Release notes for version X.X.X"
    ```
    - Replace `vX.X.X` with the new version (e.g., `v1.0.1`).
    - Write detailed release notes in the tag message, highlighting key changes or new features.

4. **Push the tag and changes** to the repository:
    ```bash
    git push origin vX.X.X
    ```
    - This will automatically trigger the GitHub action to create a new release if there are changes in `CHANGELOG.md` and a new tag is present.

5. **Open a pull request** for your branch if not yet merged:
    - Once the pull request is merged into `main` and the new tag is pushed, a GitHub Release will be created automatically.

We encourage contributions of all kinds, whether big or small. Your efforts help improve the project for everyone!
