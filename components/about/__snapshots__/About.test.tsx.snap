          Programming is both my profession and my hobby, which is why I truly enjoy my work as a developer. With over 19+ years of experience, I have the skills to tackle a wide range of challenges, from building interactive web applications to leading development teams.

          Outside of coding, my hobbies are a big part of my life. I’m an amateur astronomer and have built a fully automated remote observatory that I can control from anywhere in the world. I also love traveling, especially hiking and exploring nature with my family. My children are a constant source of inspiration, motivating me both in life and in work.
