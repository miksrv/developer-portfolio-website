        <p className={'subTitleInfo'}>
            This is a small part of my amateur projects that I continue to
            support. My hobbies are astronomy and programming and this is
            perfectly reflected in the following projects:

        <h2 className={'subTitle'}>My Experience</h2>
        <p className={'subTitleInfo'}>
            I have over 15 years of experience in creating software for a
            variety of clients - from government agencies to private companies.
            Below is a brief overview of my main technical skills and
            technologies that I use most frequently. I set the level of
            technology proficiency to be approximate, depending on the number of
            projects in which this technology was used and how often I use it.
            The longer I do not use any technology, the lower the level will be.
