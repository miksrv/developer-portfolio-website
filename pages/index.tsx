            <p className={'subTitleInfo'}>
                I have over 15 years of experience in creating software for a
                variety of clients - from government agencies to private
                companies. Below is a brief overview of my main technical skills
                and technologies that I use most frequently. I set the level of
                technology proficiency to be approximate, depending on the
                number of projects in which this technology was used and how
                often I use it. The longer I do not use any technology, the
                lower the level will be.

            <p className={'subTitleInfo'}>
                In my work and hobbies, I use not only the skills of a front-end
                developer, but also those who know the areas of analytics,
                devops engineering, database architect, web designer, API
                backend development and much more. Here is the stack of useful
                technologies I use the most.
